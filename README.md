# Paired Project Game Database Back End Repo
created by Rich Boyce and Tyller Mendoza

[GitHub FrontEnd Repo](https://github.com/tsunami-dev/front_end_single_resource) 




### Completion

To complete this project, you will need to build a full-stack application that meets the following feature and technical requirements.


#### Overall requirements

1. Create a GitHub repository for both the front-end and back-end applications and upload your code to it.
1. Both the front-end and back-end applications should be successfully deployed to the web.
1. Your front-end repository should have a `readme.md` file with setup instructions for your application.
   - Your readme should also include links to your back-end GitHub repository, both of your deployed URLs, and a link to the Trello board you used to manage your work.
1. Your project should have a coherent theme and narrative.


#### Back-end feature requirements

To complete the back-end application, you will need to build a RESTful server that performs CRUD actions on a single resource.

5. Your server should incorporate at least one table that includes:
   - A primary key
   - At least 7 total fields
   - At least 4 different data types are used among those fields
1. Your table should have at least two constraints, which can include `DEFAULT` values.
1. A route exists to create new resources.
1. A route exists to read all resources.
1. A route exists to read a single resource.
1. A route exists to update a single resource.
1. A route exists to delete a single resource.
1. An appropriate "Not Found" response is given when a route is requested that does not match the created routes.


### Stretch goals

This section of the project measures your ability to go above and beyond in creating your project. To score points in this section, you should incorporate a feature, technology, or skill not explicitly required by the project instructions.
When you submit your pull request, _make sure to include a description of any stretch goals you implemented._ You may choose from the list below or come up with features or tasks that are more relevant to your specific implementation of the project.

- The back-end application responds with a detailed and RESTful response when a resource cannot be created due to invalid data.
- The back-end application makes use of an external package to improve the code in some way. For example, it could use the [humps](https://www.npmjs.com/package/humps) package to convert between camel case (i.e., the default in JavaScript) and snake case (i.e., the default for table names in PostgreSQL).
